Ivan the fool and st Peter's fife
Oh the tsar of the forest
The cat, the cock, and the fox
The fox and the cat
The golden slipper
The iron wolf
The magic egg
The old dog
The origin of the mole
The serpent-tsarevich and his two wives
The serpent-wife
The sparrow and the bush
The story of Ivan and the daughter of the sun
The story of little tsar novishny, the false sister, and the faithful beasts
The story of the forty-first brother
The story of the unlucky days
The story of the wind
The story of tremsin, the bird zhar, and Nastasia, the lovely maid of the sea
The story of unlucky Daniel
The straw ox
The three brothers
The tsar and the angel
The two princes
The ungrateful children and the old father who went to school again
The vampire and st Michael
The voices at the window
The wondrous story of Ivan Golik and the Serpents
